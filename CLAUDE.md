## Project Status

Greenfield development of a minimal landing page for a consultant offering CAD and 3D printing services.

## Development Commands

*Commands will be added here once the project structure is established*

## Architecture Overview

It's a single page architecture. HTML5. No frills. Don't overcomplicate it. There is one form on the page, where customer can leave their name, email address and message. Upon pressing send button, an email is sent to sample@cad.com.

The page will have a few sections. You will also fill in the content.
1. What do I do? CAD services for 3D printing. Solve your immediate business need, or bring your idea to life in a way that's suitable for manufacturing.
1. Why local CAD specialist? Shipping takes time and costs money. You can iterate quickly with local manufacturer.
1. What do I do? Precise fitment, Replacement parts, custom adapters, Lamp shades (anything else that you think might be relevant)
1. Contact - The contact form goes here.

In the page header, I want a simple animated 3D mesh that gently moves as user scrolls the page, using parallax effect.

The color scheme of the page is white, black, yellow. Technical, vibrant, simple, bold.
